# Blogging-Website-Frontend
This is a frontend of a simple blogging website

Working: The frontend blogging site is dividing the whole page into different sections where each sections consist of different blogs,posters etc.It consists of three pages where in the home page on clicking on "Read more" of the "Not that's how you say it" blog it redirects to the second page i.e the second page which is the full blog and in the first page on clicking the "Get Started" button it directs to the sign-in and log-in page but that is not functional(only image have been used as buttons).

STACK USED: HTML | CSS
